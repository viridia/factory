# Render Factory Client

This package defines the web client for the factory. Note that this is just for testing and
demonstration purposes, in production the client would be integrated as part of the Nimble Studio
frontend.

## Running in development

    yarn install
    yarn start

Note that you'll need to also probably want to run the director server, at minimum.
